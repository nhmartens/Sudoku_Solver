# Sudoku Solver

This repository uses OCR to detect the initial grid of an unsolved sudoku puzzle, solves the puzzle using backtracking and then writes the solution to a new image file. The input images are preprocessed in order to detect the grid of the puzzle and scale the image to a fixed size that can be fed into the ocr-reader.
